## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Willow Weng. Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve learned that success is not achieved by chance, but by strategy. From financial analysis to project management, and now in logistics, I have built and executed strategies that transform raw data into actionable insights and measurable results.

With over four years of experience in business analytics, Iâ€™ve used Python, SQL, and advanced modeling to optimize operations, reduce costs, and strengthen profitability. For me, every challenge is a battleground, and strategy is the weapon that ensures survival and growth.

I am here because I know how to design and deliver strategies that create impactâ€”and Iâ€™m ready for the next mission.
