## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Willow Weng. My path has never been straightforwardâ€”it has been defined by challenges that demanded strategy, precision, and resilience.

I hold a Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics from the University of Washington, and a Bachelorâ€™s in Business Administration along with an MBA from the University of Nebraska. Those years taught me not only the theories of business and analytics, but how to think critically, adapt quickly, and lead with discipline.

Throughout my professional journey, I have pursued a data-driven approach to solving complex business challenges across industries such as education finance, and consulting for medical device startups, international supply chain, etc. Leveraging tools like Python, SQL, and VBA, I have built predictive models, managed complex databases, and extracted actionable insights from data to guide strategic decisions, assess risks, forecast revenue, and optimize operations. My career has been defined by applying analytical rigor to drive strategy and impact, regardless of the industry or challenge.

Now, I am committed to applying this mindset in logisticsâ€”where operational data can unlock efficiency, optimize routes, and increase profitability. For me, analytics is not just a tool; itâ€™s a way of thinking, and the foundation of every strategy I deliver.

Today, I am here because I know how to turn uncertainty into opportunity, and strategy into impact. And I am ready for the next mission.
